# RetroGT6

A retro-style graphics mod for Gran Turismo 6 on the PlayStation 3.

## About the Project

**RetroGT6** is a mod that aims to bring a nostalgic, "retro" feel to the modern classic, Gran Turismo 6. This isn't just a simple texture pack; it's a web application that leverages modern AI and web technologies to generate custom, stylized graphics. By using our platform, players can create unique, retro-themed textures and assets to replace the game's original visuals, evoking the aesthetic of early 2000s racing games. Think low-fi digital artifacts, stylized HUD elements, and a vibrant, oversaturated color scheme reminiscent of a bygone era of arcade racers.


## Tech Stack

The core of RetroGT6 is a web application that allows users to configure and generate their custom retro assets.

-   **Next.js**: The front-end is built with Next.js, providing a fast and responsive user interface for generating the mod. We use it for its server-side rendering capabilities and API routes, which handle the image generation process.
-   **Google Gemini**: We utilize the Google Gemini API for powerful image generation. Users can provide a prompt (e.g., "a vibrant, pixelated sky with a low-res sun"), and Gemini creates the corresponding texture. This allows for near-infinite customization of the mod's visual style.
