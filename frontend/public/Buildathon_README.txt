=================================================

Project Overview
----------------
The repository [Buildathon-CEC](https://github.com/Kaushik4141/Buildathon-CEC) is a project developed for the Buildathon event held at the CEC (Centro de Exposiciones y Convenciones) in Buenos Aires.
The event was part of ETH Argentina â€™23 and aimed to foster product development in the Web3 space.

The repository contains the frontend code for a decentralized application (dApp) built during the Buildathon.
The application is designed to facilitate quadratic funding for public goods projects, leveraging the CLR (Civic Learning Rewards) Fund model.
This model utilizes smart contracts to distribute funds based on community voting, ensuring a fair allocation to projects that benefit the public.
